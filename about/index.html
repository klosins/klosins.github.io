			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I received degrees in Economics and Statistics from the University of Chicago in 2017. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I developed an interest in labor economics. I was able to explore this interest through research assistantship work for Professor Steve Davis. This culminated in a senior thesis on wage posting and matching in online job markets for which I received the David S. Hu Award in Economics. Through my econometrics and statistics classes I also became interested in studying causal inference, which I have been able to explore further during the GSB Research Fellows program. I’m currently working for Professor Susan Athey looking to see how contextual bandits can be used in social science research. I’m also working with Professor Guido Imbens to investigate difference-in-differences settings with staggered policy adoption.</p>
